Detecting scratches on semiconductor wafers using coordinate map data and image segmentation. 
The project transforms tabular die data into a binary image segmentation problem, leveraging a U-Net model to identify and localize scratches. The approach automates quality control, reduces manual inspection costs, and improves defect detection accuracy. 
Achieved strong results on key metrics (IoU, Precision, Recall, AUC), with further improvements possible via hyperparameter tuning and advanced preprocessing.
